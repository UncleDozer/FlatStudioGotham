## About
A dark flat gtk2, gtk3 theme.

## Changes
Just a recoloring of the FlatStudioDark theme inspired by the Gotham Color Scheme at [terminal.sexy]: http://terminal.sexy

Unity Theme was removed (I don't use it and therefore cannot test it.)

## Installation Instructions
*Copy folder to /usr/share/themes

*Use a theme program to change themes (I recommend lxappearance.)

*__Requires gtk-engine-unico__

*__Requires gtk-engine-murrine__

## Recommendations
*Looks Great With The __Terminus__ Font
